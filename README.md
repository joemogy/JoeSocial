Complete React MERN Full Stack Social Media App
NoSQL Challenge: Social Network API
MongoDB is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data. Over the last part of this course, you’ll use several of the technologies that social networking platforms use in their full-stack applications. Because the foundation of these applications is data, it’s important that you understand how to build and structure the API first.

Your challenge is to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. You’ll use Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition to using the Express.js Links to an external site.and Mongoose Links to an external site.packages, you may also optionally use a JavaScript date library of your choice or the native JavaScript Date object to format timestamps.

Because this application won’t be deployed, you’ll also need to create a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the following acceptance criteria being met. You’ll need to submit a link to the video and add it to the README of your project.
